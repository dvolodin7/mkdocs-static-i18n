# Installation

Add `mkdocs-static-i18n` to your `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file or simply install it using `pip`. The plugin will automatically install the minimally required version of `mkdocs` it is compatible with.

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs-static-i18n
```

*It is advised to pin the version of the plugin if you're wary of forward breaking changes*.

Optionaly, you can install the plugin with its compatible minimal version of `mkdocs-material` if you're using it too, like so:

```bash
$ pip install mkdocs-static-i18n[material]
```
